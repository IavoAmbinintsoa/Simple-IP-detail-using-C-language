# Simple-IP-Detail-Using-C-Language This project provides a C script to calculate network details such as the network address, broadcast address, and number of hosts based on an IP address and subnet mask provided by the user. ## Using the `subnet` Script The `subnet` script calculates network details based on an IP address and subnet mask. Hereâ€™s how to use it and understand its output. ### Running the Script 1. Navigate to the `simple_ip_detail` directory: ```bash cd simple_ip_detail ``` 2. Compile the script (if not yet compiled): ```bash gcc -o subnet subnet.c ``` 3. Run the script with the following command: ```bash ./subnet ``` 4. The script will prompt you to enter an IP address and a subnet mask: ``` Enter the IP address (X.X.X.X): 111.1.1.1 Mask (X.X.X.X) : 192.0.0.0 ``` 5. The output will display key network details: ``` ========================================= => IP ADDRESS : 111.1.1.1 => Mask : 192.0.0.0 => Network Address : 64.0.0.0 => Broadcast Address : 127.255.255.255 => Number of Hosts : 1073741822 ========================================= ```
