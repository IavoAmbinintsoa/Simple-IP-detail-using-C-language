## Using the `subnet` Script

The `subnet` script calculates network details based on an IP address and subnet mask provided by the user. Hereâ€™s how to use it and understand its output.

### Running the Script

1. Navigate to the `simple_ip_detail` directory.
2. Run the script with the following command:
   ```bash
   ./subnet
Enter the IP address (X.X.X.X): 111.1.1.1
Mask (X.X.X.X)              : 192.0.0.0
=========================================
=> IP ADDRESS          : 111.1.1.1
=> Mask                : 192.0.0.0
=> Network Address     : 64.0.0.0
=> Broadcast Address   : 127.255.255.255
=> Number of Hosts      : 1073741822
